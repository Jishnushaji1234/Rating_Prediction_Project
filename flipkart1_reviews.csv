1035,Best in the market!,"Perfect buy as a professional laptop. It is a performance machine with extremely good battery backup. Best for mutitasking. For professionals, it would be better any day as compared to a gaming laptop. The IPS anti glare display is absolutely more than sufficient for day to day usage. Its metal lid gives it a premium look. Very few laptops are able to give you the value for your own money, and it is a value for money product.

A perfect business laptop that suits all your needs.",5
1036,Great machine at good price,"The best laptop at this price. 16GB of RAM is absolute necessity to work flawlessly. Build quality is too good with 15.6 FHD IPS display with sober brightness. The sound quality is 4 star. Laptop is very light, thin and easy to carry around. I don't play games so inbuilt Iris xe GPU is enough for me. I like more RAM because I keep sooooo many tabs an apps open at the same time. Machine is too good in performance that I want.",5

This is totally a value for money laptop with very good specs and performance. Even the design of the laptop is quite good. If ur budget is less than 58K then this would be the best selection. It handles many games giving me good fps too. It has Wifi 6 enabling high speed wifi connectivity

2401,Terrific purchase,"To be very honest this is amazing product.
The only con is that build quality is not that good but you can manage. The biggest myth is sound quality which quite loud in this but the 720p camera is very very bad , like bad as my previous laptop which was just 18000 in price .
In a nuty go for it don't think too much beleive me you will proud of your decision.

2491,Terrific purchase,"To be very honest this is amazing product.
The only con is that build quality is not that good but you can manage. The biggest myth is sound quality which quite loud in this but the 720p camera is very very bad , like bad as my previous laptop which was just 18000 in price .
In a nuty go for it don't think too much beleive me you will proud of your decision.
One thing to be noted this is my review after 2 hrs of its delivery.",5

Display is pretty good
All in all I will call this one the mid range king.",5

I got battery backup of 5 hours with browsing and watching content.

Cons: 0.9 MP webcam is below average. Speaker volume is a bit low. I use headphones so I don't mind.

The best laptop I ever upgraded upon.",5

I couldn't resist the great price point and the combination of 16 gigs of Ram with i7 10th gen & rtx 3050 ü§©just sealed the deal. The only improvement would be if bait keyboard color would be different rather than red, as red colour is kinda bad for eyes.

Was almost about to buy an 360 touch laptop for 65k,glad i changed my decision and bought m1 air as this is more value for money.

CONS:

3. 30W charger maybe slow for some.

5. Soldered 256gig SSD.

I had to manually install a fresh OS and start picking drivers n things. Lenovo should have provided a safe recovery system for such fatal errors. Rest all good.

6011,Nice,The features are not that much godd if you compare with amaze fit or noise pro 3 but at this price segment it is perfect i bought it at 1999 rs in sale and i personally think it is the cheapest smart watch with the features like spo2. So it is value for money.,3

6015,Worth every penny,I like the watch but it is not supporting some apps which i wish it could. It would help me if someone can touch base to see if this can be sorted. Some of the features like BP and Oxygen check are really useful,5
6016,Fair,I am I'm not able to to add my custom picture in the watch as a wallpaper so I I find it many ways to do it but in the end I could not find any solution to add my custom picture in the the watch itself so if you have any solution to it kindly inform me otherwise the watch is ok a the display is shorter than I thought in the pic the straps are good otherwise all the features are good except the display and I am not able to change the picture,3

7040,Decent product,"Well the product looks pretty good and feels premium too......but the main problem comes with the sensors....the spo2 sensor works only sometimes by accident most of the time it doesn't work....step tracker is also not accurate like i walk 10 steps the watch shows 20 to 30 steps hell my phn's step tracker works better than this....all the sport modes are also just present but not practical in any scenarios.....overall the money you pay i.e 2k is worth but more than 2k its just not reasonable....

7530,Very Good,Touch experience is awesome. Sensors work properly. When you raise your hand & walk then it doesn't count steps properly otherwise everything is nice in it & some times it count automatically(Ghost tracking) when I don't walk just only move my hand.,4
7531,Good,"Decent smart watch,
1.doesn't carry out real time heart rate monitoring very efficiently, it does work good when I wore it inline with my palm
2.the battery saver is of no use, just cuts off mobile pairing but the heart tracking is still on
3.the sleep monitor isn't getting updated in the app, I gave the feedback in the app but it's just bot talk",3
7532,Worth every penny,"1. Battery is great and lasts easily upto 10 days.
2. Design is sleek and stylish
3. Connectivity with phone is good and easy to track activities like sleep, step counter, calories burnt etc.
4. Sports modes are good too almost all types of workouts and training modes available.
5. Music control and silencing/rejecting calls is good

Overall a good value for money product.
Go for it if your budgets 2-2.5k",5

I bought this watch a week ago. Initial impression and look was fantastic. At first battery drained fast while connecting to mobile app. After that battery standby was excellent.

It's my first smart watch so I can't compare it with others but as my first experience I can say watch didn't disappointed me. It's been 4-5 days I'm using this and the experience of wearing this is good performance in bit lag but work is worth. Features are good for 2.5k watch. The screen quality is good.

THE BAD

Price if bought under 3000
Good display as per the price

Con-
Major con is this only - measurement is less accurate approximately 65% for walking, 90% for bp. Rest can't tell right now. But it is something around 70% accurate so please manually calculate things accordingly.

(2) whenever I keep my watch on table the heart rate sensor is turning on automatic. Hence draining battery.

(3) if you use the always on display it will consume like 30-40% battery in 3-4 hours.

10419,Nice,The features are not that much godd if you compare with amaze fit or noise pro 3 but at this price segment it is perfect i bought it at 1999 rs in sale and i personally think it is the cheapest smart watch with the features like spo2. So it is value for money.,3

10423,Worth every penny,I like the watch but it is not supporting some apps which i wish it could. It would help me if someone can touch base to see if this can be sorted. Some of the features like BP and Oxygen check are really useful,5
10424,Fair,I am I'm not able to to add my custom picture in the watch as a wallpaper so I I find it many ways to do it but in the end I could not find any solution to add my custom picture in the the watch itself so if you have any solution to it kindly inform me otherwise the watch is ok a the display is shorter than I thought in the pic the straps are good otherwise all the features are good except the display and I am not able to change the picture,3

10512,Nice product,"If call function is it there this watch is awesome , and even we can't attend call but we can see notification and reject the call , very simplest design and limited app facilities. Heart beat measurements are accurate or not I'm not sure about is steps and other calorie function are normal like other smart watch and battery capacity is depends on usage specified by the product üôÇ",4
10513,Wonderful,"Its very osm, light weight value for money, notification and activity tracker is fantastic connectivity is good, accuracy is good smooth and easy function.",5

10516,Nice,"Hi all...this is my first review in flipkart and basically I don't what to do the same..but now I am disclosing my views is that how really the watch works.

Cons:

The below views are after the updation of the app to the latest version.
1. Poor response for the notifications even we set 1 sec delay for notifications in the app
2. The heart rate monitor and blood pressure monitor is not that much accurate we can't do anything from the values displayed. So this features are almost unnecessary ...

10517,Best in the market!,"I got it for 2K, in this budget this is the best watch.
I am writing this review after 7 day of use.
Earlier i faced some issues like restarting when try to sync data and data loss when restart but after firmware update it is fixed.
Have many features like spo2, heat rate bp etc.
In 2000 this is the best watch.
It looks very premium.
Battery can last upto 4-5 days.",5
10518,Just wow!,"Awesome I suggest every one to buy this bez try new good battery life, good performance, looks classy",5
10519,Just okay,"If you are looking for some large display size then don't go for it. In terms of looks it's pretty good. And the functions like heart rate,oxygen level etc are showing approximate results. Rise to wake function is bit slow.
But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price.",3
10520,Mind-blowing purchase,"A genuinely review of the boat Strom watch

At this price it was a very good quality watch, No other brands provide watch of this specification at this price
It was a very very low weight watch.
The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.

Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,

At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it.
Thank You

Like the review if you get helped out.",5

Pros:
1 Most sensors at this price (at least on paper).
2 Nice build quality especially Strap and dial material.

Cons :
1 Heart rate sensor shows 15-20 beats more than actual (in my case).
2 SPO2 values differs upto 10-15 % every time when checked continuosly.
3 Step count is not as accurate as my MI band 5.
4 OS is not furnished right now.",2
10528,Just wow!,"Good watch during sports activities. Nice design.. Display of step counting is very small for older people. Bp, oxigen count and heart beat are almost accurate... Any way good item.. Battery will last for 6 days",5
10529,Does the job,"Some of functions needs to be upgraded, hoat pro gear app is the only way to operate the functions. It does not support google Wear OS app. Most important, the available dail looks are just ordinary not so cool. Watching time function is not user friendly. Touch is good but dial looks small. Bluetooth range is also a constraint. Can be much better",3

It also has BP and Oxegen monitor as well which can be handily not for accurate use.

For 2.5k it is ok but don't spend much on these watches if you are looking for some serious lifestyle. Just use it for casual fitness tracker for basics.

Overall its a good device in this ...

The watch module is robust though it needs a protective case to retain its sheen. The UI is intuitive and slick with minimal stutters. The Fitness measuring parameters are industry standard. The biggest issue is the battery life which lasts 1.5 days even with minimal usage.

Pros:

I'd say go for it if you want a great fitness tracker with looks of a premium watch.",5
13212,Simply awesome,This is a masterpiece from Dizo. The only drawback which I feel is there are only four inbuilt watch faces in the watch and you can only add and save one extra watch face from the app. The watch faces in the app are good but not up to the mark. If Dizo fixes these in its upcoming updates then it would be tremendous. Otherwise everything is great in this smart watch...,5

13295,Nice,"Display is awesome. Features are there but what good it is if it doesn't work correctly. Like raise to wake is too sensitive that display gets on with moderate hand movement and also the watch says my bed is alive. My bed has heart rate, spo2 and one day I put my watch on bed and it also slept for 2 hrs.üò± They could fix it with some updates i guess. But for the money we should expect such flaws I believe.",3
13296,Fabulous!,"For me its worth buying, so let me gove you clear review. We have 3 watch and for me battery works 9-10 days, and its not same for all. My wife has 6 days back up and my brother has 6-8 days. Screen is super cool and best thing is you can change wallpaper all the time. Always on screen features can be improved. Other features are also good for tracking.",5
13297,Nice product,"Value for money smartwatch.

Pros:-
1. The screen's visibility is good at indoors.
2. The watch is comfortable to wear
3. Good battery life(8-10 days) if always on-display is off
4. Sop2 and heart rate monitor shows accurate readings.

Cons:-
1. If always-on-display is ON then the battery will last for 2-3 days only.
2. The visibility is poor under bright sun.",4

13301,Just wow!,"Great watch for the price. Looking is great too. Dial size is ideal for all wrist sizes. My wrist is relatively small but even on my wrist it fits well. Battery life is great, its been on 100% for last 7 hours with moderate usage. Plenty of watch faces available. App is decent, sometimes takes time to load all watch faces but not a dealbreaker. I'd say go for it if you want a great fitness tracker with looks of a premium watch.",5
13302,Simply awesome,This is a masterpiece from Dizo. The only drawback which I feel is there are only four inbuilt watch faces in the watch and you can only add and save one extra watch face from the app. The watch faces in the app are good but not up to the mark. If Dizo fixes these in its upcoming updates then it would be tremendous. Otherwise everything is great in this smart watch...,5

13453,Great product,Beautiful watch. Gifted this to my husband and he loved the watch and colour as well. A must buy product for gadget lovers..!!,5
13454,Worth the money,"The watch feels really comfy and attractive in the hand. The Realtime Heart monitor and other features such as oxygen level monitor stress level indicator and so on meets the expectations. The cons I felt is that the watch faces weren't that attractive and the battery level is not as promised. It drains off quickly. Last only 3-4 days, when it was promised for 10days. Overall it's a good smartwatch at a decent price.",4
13455,Brilliant,Looks and feels nice and premium with great features. I really love the stress monitor and spo2 sensor. It's ui needs to improve though and add some more face watches... overall it's a good quality budget smartwatch.,5

1. Good Budget watch almost accurate SPO2, HR and sleep Tracking
2.Look wise really good
3.Light Weight
Cons
1.Battery Drainage issue...
100 to 82% in just 10 minutes.
2.Pedometer does not work properly counts steps even if you are travelling.
3.Vibration when notification recieved is very irritating.
4.Limited watch faces.
5. Plastic casing",3
13460,Good quality product,"The watch looks soo good, but the noisefit application often disconnects the bluetooth to the watch which makes it to loose the 5 star rating.

Pros: Watch faces are good,
Good battery life,
watch interface is so smooth and well designed,
Heart rate monitor, SPo2, stress monitoring sensors works well

Cons: Noisefit app is worst
Disconnects the watch too often, (It is the major drawback)
Strap is not too extraordinary but just ok.",4
13461,Really Nice,"Watch is good in its price segment.for new buyers i would like to say that yeah its good ,not very advance neither its worst .you will like it after buying it,u wont regret of why i brought it.

13462,Really Nice,"It's a great product overall.... really very impressed ü§©üôåüèª...
The only downside is the battery backup on this device is really very low I used it for 3 days only and it has dropped from 96% to 24% ...the battery may last for 5to6 day max on total use..yes I had use all the features in this 3 days and considering that it is fine by me.
The design the display are both awesome it's lite weight and feels premium....
I hope my review was usefull .",4
13463,Good choice,"Considering the cost of the smart watch, this is an easy go kinda accessory with adequate specs.

13472,Very Good,"Review after 7 days of usage:
Pros :-
1. The watch has a sturdy built and nice removable straps. Gives a premium look
2. It has a blood oxygen sensor(spo2) which is very important in this covid time.
3. The heart rate monitor also works fine. Nearly accurate results.
4. The accelerometer ( step count) also works fine if you are walking over 20 steps. For below 20 steps it doesn't count many of the times. But that can be ignored coz above 20 it gives accurate results in walking and running.

A very good product to wear when in move.,4

I think the best smart watch under 4000..
So jst go for it..",5
13947,Nice,"looks like over hyped. Just like any other watch. not much to boast of. Finish of the product is good and doesn't appear cheap from any angle. Screen wake-up is not that responsive, i have to bend my wrist a couple of times before the screen wakes up and tells time. Very few watch faces available ""in-watch"". Even the custom designed watchface is not saved in phone as soon as you change it with inbuilt watch face.",3

6. Raise to wake is very responsive, i found it better than my gts 2 mini.
7. Heart rate monitor is accurate.

As they say there are 110+ sports modes, no its almost wrong

1st they say that order will be delivered till 19june,then after the too much excitement of 19th June , they say that they will deliver till 21 June

I'd say go for it if you want a great fitness tracker with looks of a premium watch.",5
14022,Simply awesome,This is a masterpiece from Dizo. The only drawback which I feel is there are only four inbuilt watch faces in the watch and you can only add and save one extra watch face from the app. The watch faces in the app are good but not up to the mark. If Dizo fixes these in its upcoming updates then it would be tremendous. Otherwise everything is great in this smart watch...,5

Battery is bad, lasts about 3 days in normal use and only 1 day if you keep the calling on.

16366,Simply awesome,Very much satisfied with the new monitor. I upgraded my old monitor with this one. Display clarity is great. Registered the product with Samsung product registration online and was able to view the warranty information.,5
16367,Good choice,"Samsung makes good tv's. With monitors, it's a little different. From 2 feet distance, even the lowest brightness settings on this are severely discomforting. Only way to use this is to turn down rbg individually at zero brightness. Then, this becomes useful.
The eye care mode is a joke - the panel would become warm and really bright while the brightness settings are disabled.
If you want to buy Samsung - like I did - get this. Good for watching content now n then. For serious 10 hr+ workdays...

16369,Fabulous!,"Five stars for the product 2 stars for flipkart.

I needed a second monitor for my work and it is best choice for me. No edge bleeding colors are almost near to perfect. Bezzles are thin, look wise good

Cons:

This is not a con but it took me a while to get that the power itself is the menu control button.

There are only 1 HDMI (cable included in the box, I really appreciate that) and 1 old school VGA which is of no use these days for many of the people.


I'm not a fan of the power brick.

I would suggest 22' is best fit 1080p. if you go for 24' best option for 4k or with plain eye you can see the pixel in monitor since we are close to monitor. So your thumbs up if its helps..,4
16706,Brilliant,best in its class. wonderful colours and stunning display. perfect for editing photos and gaming. good movie experience as well.,5
16707,Delightful,"Budget monitor with best visual experience. Any kind of high end video it plays smoothly from HD to UHD, the picture modes are very good. Color definitions are good color differentiation is also very good, but one issue is there and that is the sound of the monitor. Don't depend on the inbuilt speakers of the monitor the sounds are very low but the sound quality is good. I would suggest this monitor without a second thought.",4
16708,Must buy!,"I have both same monitor for programming with vertical setup.
This monitor is good for eyes, also good in these prices.
IPS is really good for programming and sitting 10-12 hr in front of screen.

Must buy without any problem.
Love it",5
16709,Brilliant,I bought it for my PC and PS3. First of all Picture quality and viewing angles are great. The bright intelligence is such a nice feature especially at this price range. You can use it with lights on or off without having to adjust the brightness constantly. Been using it for a week and I haven't had any dead pixels yet. There is a slight light bleeding In the bottom 2 corners which is very common for ips panel displays. Highly recommended for movie streaming or console gaming.,5
16710,Beautiful Monitor,"Very simple and good looking design. Could not afford full sRGB monitor. But this NTSC 72% almost cover sRGB range. Didn't try eye protection capability, as it will hinder my work on photoshop. Over all vibrant colour. complete mat front surface, no annoying reflection. Cable manager behind the stand is good. Over all good experience. I don't play games, so refresh rate no matter to me. in-built speaker are not at all loud. But having in-built speaker in this price range itself is a plus. Wid...

Some things one should consider before buying are this.
1. It does not support HDR, its SDR.
2. Plug is for 10A 250V, so it will work on 16A plug of one's house and not the regular one.

All is good otherwise. I thought speaker would be bad before buying but it is sufficient enough for the desks distance and some meetings, no mic or webcam. Only budget monitor with 2 HDMI ports currently.

Out of the box it's at 60Hz unless you turn on freesync. You can unlock the 75Hz even on Nvidia graphics cards, except it won't support the AMD freesync technology. You get an HDMI cable out of the box too, even though I didn't see it being mentioned in the product page.
Please do note that you can't enter BIOS while having the freesync op...

MY RECOMMEND TO BUY THIS MONITOR",5
18433,Terrific purchase,Just go for this Monitor. This is a awesome choice. Nice picture clarity and smoothness in video playing. It's very narrow bezel is another plus point when you are watching movie on it. View angle in no dought very good as it is an IPS. I think under Rs.10000/- this is the best 22 inch monitor.,5
18434,Best buy,I'm using titan x with i9 processor and I don't have enough money to replace my 720p Sony Bravia and u know when I bought it then I can't believe on my self this led provides 75 hz refresh rate at 1080 p and the display is so clear this is too god under such price must buy,5
18435,Wonderful,Overall a very good monitor. Just that it comes without a VGA cable you get only a HDMI cable with the power cable in the box. In case you are changing from a CRT monitor to a LCD you might need to purchase a VGA to VGA cable separately.(It should have come in the box seriously). IPS panel is the right opinion plus you can go all the way to 75htz quiet a good option for gamers on a budget.,4

Acer support is fantastic. If you get any error while connecting to laptop just call acer and do the troubleshooting. The price on big billion days was 6.5k. So keep looking for deals.,5

Would surely advice anyone to go for it. But you should also be able to live with the fact that isn't adjustable according to your wish. Also if there is any other color variant available then please go with a darker variant. It won't stay study and might wobble a little if there is any movement of the desk it is kept on.

19716,Superb product and a value for money,"I bought it in big billion days sale at a very good deal, The overall picture quality is superb, the product is sleek in design,
I'm non-gamer use it mostly for work and content watching.

Cons: The color Calibration could have been better

The delivery from Flipkart partner Xpressbees is pathetic 0/5, though the product arrived at the nearest hub on time, I had to manually pick up the product after waiting for 5 days, my product was under the pile of other deliveries.
no proper assistance ...

19717,Nice,Used it for 2 week i feel its good monitor as Its a lcd screen with led backlit. And as its 1080p for 27 inch you can clearly see the pixel dots when you work on it good for daily needs but not preferred for gaming for 3d works or content creation,3

PROS:
75hz [through hdmi]
5ms response time
IPS panel [beautiful viewing angle ]
AMD free sync
color calibrated
cross hair feature for fps games
black stabilizer
headphone jack
CONS:
The main con is, 60fps videos in youtube will be choppy when you are at 75hz. This is the problem of all 75hz/144hz monitor. Basically you cant divide 75/144 with 60, hence the video will be choppy. turning the refresh rate to 60hz will allow you to watch the video smoothly . ...

20863,Best in the market!,"A really good option if you're looking for a budget gaming monitor. It has display port(which doesn't usually come at this price range) to support Freesync in Nvidia GPUs. Very little to nil backlight bleeding. The IPS glow is evenly distributed. 75hz refresh rate is a good step up but not a great one. The features like black stabilizer and inbuilt crosshair are really useful ones. Eventually, this is the best product you could get at this price range. Go for it without any second thought.",5

21421,Does the job,Monitor is good but if you consider this for speaker please do not go for it. This one has worst built in speakers in it. You will have to use an external speaker.,3
21422,Just okay,"First time when i received the monitor it had 10 to 12 black spots or dead pixels.

Flipkart helped me to replace the monitor with new one. But upon checking, again, i found multiple dead spots on screen.
But, as second time the number of dead pixels were less, i accepted it.

But is disappointing to see dead pixels on your new screen. Especially, when you choose brand like LG.",3
